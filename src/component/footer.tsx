<p>Cash Account is offered by Wealthfront Brokerage LLC (Wealthfront Brokerage), member FINRA / SIPC. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on cash deposits is as of November 15, 2024, and is subject to change at any time before or after the Cash Account is opened. Wealthfront Brokerage nor any of its affiliates are a bank and Cash Account is not a checking or savings account. There is no minimum balance required to open or maintain the Cash Account. Funds in the Cash Account are swept to partner banks, where they earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance. FDIC insurance is not provided until the funds arrive at the program banks. FDIC insurance coverage is limited to $250,000 per qualified customer account per banking institution. Wealthfront uses more than one program bank to ensure FDIC coverage of up to $8 million for your cash deposits. Conditions apply. Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each program bank, including those held at partner banks outside of Wealthfront Brokerage’s sweep program, to ensure FDIC coverage limits are not exceeded. If a client opts out of one or more partner banks, the FDIC insurance available on the cash deposits may be lowered. For more information about FDIC insurance, visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held at partner banks are not protected by SIPC.</p>
<p>The APY for the Wealthfront Cash Account represents the weighted average of the APY on the aggregate deposit balances of all clients at the program banks. Deposit balances are not allocated equally among the participating program banks.</p>

<p>Investing in US Treasuries involves risks, including but not limited to interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk. While US Treasuries are considered to be among the safest investments, they are not entirely risk-free, and there is potential for loss of principal. Returns on US Treasuries can be affected by changes in the credit rating of the US government, although such occurrences are rare. Investors should consider their tolerance for these risks and their overall investment objectives before investing in US Treasuries.</p>
<p>The yield earned from US Treasuries is exempt from state and local income taxes. However, interest income from Treasuries is subject to federal income tax. To understand implications for your specific situation, consult with a tax professional.</p>
<p>Tax loss harvesting may generate a higher number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a chance that trading attributed to tax loss harvesting may create capital gains and wash sales and could be subject to higher transaction costs and market impacts. In addition, tax loss harvesting strategies may produce losses, which may not be offset by sufficient gains in the account and may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against income.</p>
<p>Instant and same day withdrawals may be processed through the Real-Time Payments (RTP) network or the FedNow® service, enabling same day withdrawals. Please note, Real-Time Payments (RTP) transfers may be limited by destination institutions, daily transaction caps, and by participating entities such as Wells Fargo and the RTP® Network.</p>
